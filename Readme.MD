## Potato Disease Classification Project

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify various diseases affecting potato plants. By leveraging image processing and advanced classification algorithms, the model aims to accurately identify diseases from images of potato leaves. This can help farmers and agricultural professionals take timely actions to manage and treat potato diseases, ultimately improving crop yield and quality.

### Key Features
- **Image Processing**: Techniques to preprocess and enhance images of potato leaves.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementation of classification algorithms to identify diseases.
- **Dataset**: Utilization of a labeled dataset containing images of healthy and diseased potato leaves.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics to assess the accuracy and performance of the model.

### Goals
- Develop a reliable and efficient disease classification model.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for farmers to upload images and get instant disease diagnosis.
- Contribute to the agricultural community by reducing crop losses due to diseases.

### Tools and Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn

### Future Work
- Expand the dataset with more diverse images.
- Improve model accuracy with advanced deep learning techniques.
- Develop a mobile application for easy access and use by farmers.
